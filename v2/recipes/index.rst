Code Recipes
============

A list of code samples/examples outlining how to create and load
and manipulate commerce entities entirely in code.

These recipes are all designed to work off of each other, so try it out
- you can run all the code in a single shot from top to bottom.

To get a good understanding of the various entity relations this diagram can be helpful: `Drupal Commerce 2 entity relations - including Shipping <https://www.dx-experts.nl/commerce-2-entity-relations-including-shipping>`_
