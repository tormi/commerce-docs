Creating a Coupon
=================

Let's now imagine that you're running a new email campaign that sends customers a coupon that they can use to get 15% off each order over $100. Setting up a coupon based promotion is almost exactly the same as creating a new promotion.

You go through the a `same steps as creating a promotion <creating-a-promotion.rst>`__, but with one exception. You now use the "Add New Coupon" button and add the following:

- Enter a specific coupon code
- Mark it as active
- Set the number of times this coupon can be used

Finally, "Save" the promotion. Let's test this out by adding a few products that amount to an order total of over $100. Notice that a discount is not automatically applied as you have added a coupon to the promotion. Instead, in the "Checkout" page, you can see a 'Coupon code' textfield. Enter the coupon code in the promotion and hit "Apply coupon". You can now see that the 15% discount has been applied to the entire order.
